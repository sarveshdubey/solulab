Together, we can bridge the gap between product documentation and field engineering implementation experiences, and ultimately share that knowledge with the world.\n\n In the role of a Technical Content Developer, you build content curriculum by working with Tanzu Labs Solution Architects (professional services), technical writers, and product managers to capture the knowledge required to successfully implement the Tanzu portfolio. You create, curate and distribute on-demand content through multiple online channels, including public websites, internal enablement platforms, learning management systems. You will also have the opportunity to present during webinars and conferences. You will also work closely with our target audience to get early feedback, and to develop feedback loops to help the team continually improve its material.\n\n You get to work across a diverse array of technologies. As a technical content developer, you might work on developing material about core Kubernetes topics for one month, then transition to work on material about secure software supply chains, or practices for deploying various styles of applications. This means you are constantly learning about new technologies and new customer needs.\n\n The content creators for Platform Services start new initiatives every 3 - 6 months. This gives the team opportunities to become immersed in new problems, and a wide array of potential solutions throughout the year.\n\n At Platform Services, our sweet spot is teaching clients how to be more effective at implementing Tanzu based platforms.

You’ve learned our practices, and applied your engineering, curriculum development, and communications skills to develop content, and you’ve also contributed your knowledge to the team effort. You’ve created mechanisms to implement feedback loops with your target audience to help keep the material relevant for the jobs to be done by the learner. You have also made great strides in increasing your knowledge of the Tanzu product family, and the problems Tanzu solves for customers.\n\n\n\n1st six months: You’ve made amazing improvements to your ability to deliver great content to your audience. You’ve rolled out several pieces of content to a progression of audiences, and your first content is live in one of our major channels, being used by platform engineers around the globe. Many people have told you how useful your material is at helping them adopt the new technology they rely on. Consumption of your material has caught fire, and is getting great reviews.\n\n\n\n1st Year: You’ve created a deep portfolio of highly rated learning material on a variety of topics that is in high demand by cutting edge platform engineers around the globe. You’ve presented at major technology conferences. You have honed your techniques for digesting new technology and teaching it to others.

What are the assignments, requirements, or skills that you will be performing on a regular basis?\n\n Although your regular activities may be modified to suit your professional strengths, daily life at Tanzu Labs may include many, if not all of the following requirements:\n\n\nBe a crucial member of a team dedicated to building great learning material that helps platform engineers learn new technology, new tools and new techniques to increase their effectiveness.\nCreate written content, slides, diagrams, blend prescriptive and objective lab exercises to teach complex new ideas to learners.\nPresent material to learners both as live presentations, and as recorded presentations for large scale distribution.\nCollaborate daily with team members, and deliver great learning products into our distribution channels.\nWork on user stories from a prioritized backlog.

We have a bias towards action and love to test ideas so we can learn and improve. We have learned that being empathetic, inclusive, and kind empowers people to achieve greatness. We look forward to welcoming team members, and work hard to make sure the onboarding process is smooth.\n\n Where is this role located?\n Like many companies, the COVID pandemic changed how we work. We are fortunate to be capable of running a strong business in a 100% remote working environment.\n\n However, we believe that the fastest way to build authentic relationships is in person. Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely when we have to, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect more in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site (<20%)\n\n What are the benefits and perks of working at VMware?\n You and your loved ones will be supported with a competitive and comprehensive benefits package.

Together, we can bridge the gap between product documentation and field engineering implementation experiences, and ultimately share that knowledge with the world.\n\n In the role of a Technical Content Developer, you build content curriculum by working with Tanzu Labs Solution Architects (professional services), technical writers, and product managers to capture the knowledge required to successfully implement the Tanzu portfolio. You create, curate and distribute on-demand content through multiple online channels, including public websites, internal enablement platforms, learning management systems.

We are fortunate to be capable of running a strong business in a 100% remote working environment.\n\n However, we believe that the fastest way to build authentic relationships is in person. Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely when we have to, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect more in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site (<20%)\n\n What are the benefits and perks of working at VMware?\n You and your loved ones will be supported with a competitive and comprehensive benefits package.

Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely when we have to, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect more in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site (<20%)\n\n What are the benefits and perks of working at VMware?\n You and your loved ones will be supported with a competitive and comprehensive benefits package.

Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely when we have to, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days.
