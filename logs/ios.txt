Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.\n Today, we partner with sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, and merchants who began selling with Square and have grown more significant. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions, and we all grow together.\n There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting.
