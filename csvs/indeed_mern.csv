Customers expect thoughtful, comprehensive experiences from companies they trust and that's what we do.

What we have in common are differences. Across our offices, we boast different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different ideas. There's room at the table for everyone, and that's where the real magic happens. We are constantly challenging each other to push the limits of our creative and strategic capabilities to solve complex problems and make an impact. You can help us make a bigger impact!

 Lead Engineer


 Are you an experienced engineer with a passion for seeing the impact of your work? Do you like managing and mentoring engineers, leading projects from a technology viewpoint and delivering quality code while minimizing technical debt? If you value the technical foundation and the end-user experience of the products you build, a headless CMS over a monolithic WordPress instance, and a microservices architecture that incorporates SaaS, then this Lead Engineer role may be perfect for you!
 A bit about us


 We're ADK Group, a projekt202 company. Since our founding, we've been building the company at which we'd want to work – one with an inclusive culture where everyone collaborates as a team, solves big problems, has fun, and creates opportunities for everyone. Now, as part of projekt202, we're a global team of digital product leaders working everyday to solve complex technology problems and create digital experiences that transform organizations.


 We are on a mission to help businesses adapt through technology. We work with local Boston leaders like Firefly Health, Wasabi Technologies, and ALKU and global institutions like Mass General Brigham, Santander Bank, and Cambridge Associates. We operate as a remote team, with primary talent hubs in downtown Boston, Louisville, KY and Medellin, CO. Through projekt202, we are part of a team of over 900 technologists and strategists working out of offices in Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney AUS, and Auckland NZ. Together, we are building a new type of product engineering consultancy, one that is growing rapidly locally, nationally, and internationally.
 So what's the role?


 We're looking for a Lead Engineer with full stack experience to help determine and execute technology solutions, from contributing to architecture to ensuring the quality of the code and the success of the project for various types of client engagements.  In this role, you'll manage engineers and projects. You'll apply critical thinking to keep projects on track from a technical perspective, including performing code reviews, mentoring engineers, and removing blockers for the engineers specifically but also for the larger team, while supporting the desired outcome.


 You're comfortable interfacing with internal and external stakeholders, including clients, vendors, and other internal departments, and researching new technologies/solutions and prototyping them. You possess an advanced understanding of computer science fundamentals and are excited by and interested in evaluating and implementing SaaS solutions when appropriate and building from scratch when necessary. You use your intelligence and experience to create simple, elegant solutions to complex, abstract problems. You create order out of chaos. You're confident in your knowledge and don't create bloated codebases to prove yourself. You're eager to continue learning and willing to share your knowledge with the team.


 Getting down to specifics, you have at least ten years of hands-on, professional full-stack programming experience with any combination of JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, Python, PHP, Ruby/RoR, C# and .NET, as well as relational/SQL and NoSQL databases. Ideally you are knowledgeable about the JAMStack architecture and are a proponent of and can evangelize the MACH ecosystem, which means you have broad experience with microservices, an API-First approach, cloud-native SaaS applications and headless applications. GraphQL experience is a plus, as is experience implementing low-code/no-code solutions. Experience in a fast-paced, team-based environment is crucial.


 On a daily basis you may find yourself unblocking an engineer on a project you are leading, performing a code review and recommending improvements, contributing to system architecture, defining code architecture, researching a potential SaaS partner and creating a prototype, or writing or documenting code.


 We hope we've piqued your interest! If you're a passionate Lead Engineer who enjoys working with smart, humble people on exciting challenges that make an impact, this could be the perfect position for you!


 Here's what you'll be responsible for:

Managing a team of engineers and be responsible for their career advancement
Leading a team of engineers on one or more projects and be responsible for the quality of the code for that project or projects, including leading code architecture and refactoring
Leading a team of engineers on one or more projects and be responsible for the success of the project from a technology perspective as it contributes to the desired outcome, which means also supporting the larger team
Contributing to architecting complex web applications with the MERN and PERN stack, JAMStack and MACH architectures, and popular SaaS platforms
Thinking critically and applying your knowledge and experience to achieve superior client outcomes
Interfacing with sales and other teams to foster communication and enable success
Researching new technologies and prototyping potential solutions that fulfill the needs of our clients and their customers
Conveying technical information and solutions to clients, project managers, and other internal team members across departments in an easy-to-understand manner
Guiding engineers toward efficient solutions to technical challenges



 The experience we're looking for:

3+ years of experience interfacing with internal and external stakeholders, including clients, vendors, and other internal departments
4+ years of experience leading the technology aspect of custom web and mobile application projects from concept to launch and beyond
10+ years of experience with any combination of JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, Python, Ruby/RoR, PHP, C# and/or .NET
Experience with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL or MySQL server
Experience with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
Experience with REST APIs and/or GraphQL
Experience with JAMStack and the MACH ecosystem
Familiarity with popular Microservices patterns
Experience researching and implementing low-code/no-code solutions
Strong written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to convey technical information and solutions to clients and project managers in an easy-to-understand manner
Authorized to work in the U.S.

Our mission is simple: To build the world's leading platform for hourly workers and enterprises enabling flexibility, choice, and upward social mobility.
 What you'll do:

Own a vertical pillar or horizontal function within our Product & Engineering team.

Design, architect, and build highly-performant and reliable technical features, tools, and services using Node.js, React/React Native, Mongo, Python, GCP.

You enjoy working cross functionally with leadership, PMs, designers, and other engineers to build products across a modern tech stack (MERN) to solve complex problems.
You are eager to work in a dynamic and fast-paced early stage startup, and have an ability to roll up your sleeves to #GetShiftDone.


Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart
 See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)


 Execution Is Binary
 We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.
 We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.
 Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".


 Missionaries, Not Mercenaries
 We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.
 We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.
 We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.


 Inputs > Outcomes
 We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.
 We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.
 We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.
 We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.


 Honesty Over Harmony
 We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.
 We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.
 We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.
 We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.


 Invent & Iterate
 We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.
 We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.
 We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
 
Equal opportunity employer
 Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

 Lead Engineer


 Are you an experienced engineer with a passion for seeing the impact of your work? Do you like managing and mentoring engineers, leading projects from a technology viewpoint and delivering quality code while minimizing technical debt? If you value the technical foundation and the end-user experience of the products you build, a headless CMS over a monolithic WordPress instance, and a microservices architecture that incorporates SaaS, then this Lead Engineer role may be perfect for you!
 A bit about us


 We're ADK Group, a projekt202 company. Since our founding, we've been building the company at which we'd want to work – one with an inclusive culture where everyone collaborates as a team, solves big problems, has fun, and creates opportunities for everyone. Now, as part of projekt202, we're a global team of digital product leaders working everyday to solve complex technology problems and create digital experiences that transform organizations.


 We are on a mission to help businesses adapt through technology. We work with local Boston leaders like Firefly Health, Wasabi Technologies, and ALKU and global institutions like Mass General Brigham, Santander Bank, and Cambridge Associates. We operate as a remote team, with primary talent hubs in downtown Boston, Louisville, KY and Medellin, CO. Through projekt202, we are part of a team of over 900 technologists and strategists working out of offices in Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney AUS, and Auckland NZ. Together, we are building a new type of product engineering consultancy, one that is growing rapidly locally, nationally, and internationally.
 So what's the role?


 We're looking for a Lead Engineer with full stack experience to help determine and execute technology solutions, from contributing to architecture to ensuring the quality of the code and the success of the project for various types of client engagements.  In this role, you'll manage engineers and projects. You'll apply critical thinking to keep projects on track from a technical perspective, including performing code reviews, mentoring engineers, and removing blockers for the engineers specifically but also for the larger team, while supporting the desired outcome.


 You're comfortable interfacing with internal and external stakeholders, including clients, vendors, and other internal departments, and researching new technologies/solutions and prototyping them. You possess an advanced understanding of computer science fundamentals and are excited by and interested in evaluating and implementing SaaS solutions when appropriate and building from scratch when necessary. You use your intelligence and experience to create simple, elegant solutions to complex, abstract problems. You create order out of chaos. You're confident in your knowledge and don't create bloated codebases to prove yourself. You're eager to continue learning and willing to share your knowledge with the team.


 Getting down to specifics, you have at least ten years of hands-on, professional full-stack programming experience with any combination of JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, Python, PHP, Ruby/RoR, C# and .NET, as well as relational/SQL and NoSQL databases. Ideally you are knowledgeable about the JAMStack architecture and are a proponent of and can evangelize the MACH ecosystem, which means you have broad experience with microservices, an API-First approach, cloud-native SaaS applications and headless applications. GraphQL experience is a plus, as is experience implementing low-code/no-code solutions. Experience in a fast-paced, team-based environment is crucial.


 On a daily basis you may find yourself unblocking an engineer on a project you are leading, performing a code review and recommending improvements, contributing to system architecture, defining code architecture, researching a potential SaaS partner and creating a prototype, or writing or documenting code.


 We hope we've piqued your interest! If you're a passionate Lead Engineer who enjoys working with smart, humble people on exciting challenges that make an impact, this could be the perfect position for you!


 Here's what you'll be responsible for:

Managing a team of engineers and be responsible for their career advancement
Leading a team of engineers on one or more projects and be responsible for the quality of the code for that project or projects, including leading code architecture and refactoring
Leading a team of engineers on one or more projects and be responsible for the success of the project from a technology perspective as it contributes to the desired outcome, which means also supporting the larger team
Contributing to architecting complex web applications with the MERN and PERN stack, JAMStack and MACH architectures, and popular SaaS platforms
Thinking critically and applying your knowledge and experience to achieve superior client outcomes
Interfacing with sales and other teams to foster communication and enable success
Researching new technologies and prototyping potential solutions that fulfill the needs of our clients and their customers
Conveying technical information and solutions to clients, project managers, and other internal team members across departments in an easy-to-understand manner
Guiding engineers toward efficient solutions to technical challenges



 The experience we're looking for:

3+ years of experience interfacing with internal and external stakeholders, including clients, vendors, and other internal departments
4+ years of experience leading the technology aspect of custom web and mobile application projects from concept to launch and beyond
10+ years of experience with any combination of JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, Python, Ruby/RoR, PHP, C# and/or .NET
Experience with PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL or MySQL server
Experience with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
Experience with REST APIs and/or GraphQL
Experience with JAMStack and the MACH ecosystem
Familiarity with popular Microservices patterns
Experience researching and implementing low-code/no-code solutions
Strong written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to convey technical information and solutions to clients and project managers in an easy-to-understand manner
Authorized to work in the U.S.

Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart
 See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)


 Execution Is Binary
 We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.
 We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.
 Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".


 Missionaries, Not Mercenaries
 We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.
 We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.
 We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.


 Inputs > Outcomes
 We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.
 We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.
 We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.
 We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.


 Honesty Over Harmony
 We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.
 We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.
 We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.
 We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.


 Invent & Iterate
 We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.
 We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.
 We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
 
Equal opportunity employer
 Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Our mission is simple: To build the world's leading platform for hourly workers and enterprises enabling flexibility, choice, and upward social mobility.

You enjoy working cross functionally with leadership, PMs, designers, and other engineers to build products across a modern tech stack (MERN) to solve complex problems.
You are eager to work in a dynamic and fast-paced early stage startup, and have an ability to roll up your sleeves to #GetShiftDone.


Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart
 See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)


 Execution Is Binary
 We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.
 We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.
 Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".


 Missionaries, Not Mercenaries
 We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.
 We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.
 We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.


 Inputs > Outcomes
 We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.
 We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.
 We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.
 We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.


 Honesty Over Harmony
 We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.
 We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.
 We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.
 We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.


 Invent & Iterate
 We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.
 We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.
 We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
 
Equal opportunity employer
 Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

97,Senior Ruby on Rails Engineer - Always Remote,Quimbee,"Remote in Charlotte, NC","$90,000 - $160,000 a year",2022-09-24,"

Founded in 2007, Quimbee is one of the most widely used e-learning platforms for law students and attorneys in the United States. Quimbee has a massive digital library of content designed to help law students and attorneys succeed, every step of the way. We're looking to expand our team of talented professionals.

 Since 2007, Quimbee has helped over 500,000 law students and attorneys achieve academic and professional success.
 As our site has grown, so has our need for exceptional designers and developers. We have had the privilege of working with some outstanding dev shops in the past, but we've moved on to building our own full-time dev team since 2014. With our application growing in size, usage, and complexity, we're looking to welcome a new versatile, experienced developer to the team. That's where you come in.
 This position is 100% remote.
 What You'll Do
 Develop new features for our product, working with our content and other creative teams. Watch our infrastructure and investigate reported issues (everyone joins in on the fun.) You'll join a small tech team, so your voice will be heard when we need to make new technical decisions as our product grows. We expect you to go beyond coding to give input on the product roadmap, design, and architecture.
 Who You Are
 You must be a senior developer. Technically, we're mostly interested in your recent Ruby on Rails and general web-development experience at all levels of the stack, from Angular (or similar) front-end apps, to dealing with search engines, DB query tuning, and everything in between, but we'd expect you to have worked with other languages/frameworks during your career.

A versatile engineer. You know what you don't know and feel comfortable learning new skills. You're not ashamed of recognizing mistakes, and you take measures to avoid falling again.


A team player. Working remotely doesn't mean you're going to work alone. We share code ownership as much as possible. You'll have to fix other people's code as much as other teammates will be fixing yours.


A full-stack developer. You have lots of experience building Rails applications, and you're also very comfortable writing front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS).


A minimalist. You believe a new feature should be built only when the evidence supports it. You're willing to push back when you believe this rule is being ignored or violated.


A great communicator. You communicate your ideas, feedback, and criticism thoroughly, clearly, and courteously. You believe there's no such thing as over-explaining or over-clarifying because that's how miscommunication is avoided.

Requirements

5+ years experience in Ruby on Rails development
B.S. in computer science or a closely related field
HTML5, CSS, JS fluency
Know how the web works under the hood. TCP, HTTP, DNS, IP, caches, etc.
Experience writing tests and refactoring. We use Rspec and Capybara.
Comfortable with Git and version-control. Experience solving complex merging conflicts.
Strong knowledge of SQL in general and PostgreSQL in particular



 Bonus Points for experience with:

Experience with Stripe
Experience with frontend frameworks like HTMX or Stimulus
Hosting apps in Heroku, monitoring, and scaling them up/down
Implementing a custom Ruby CMS
Implementing a SaaS application or experience with subscription-based businesses generally
Implementing user-visible dashboards, graphing data, and showing stats/analytics in general

What We Offer:

Salary range: $90,000-$160,000 annually, commensurate with education and experience.
Profit share. We set aside a percentage of profits each year and then pay them out across the team.
Group health insurance, dental, vision, life, and disability coverage for US-based employees.
401k matching up to 4% (100% matching up to 3% and 50% between 3% and 5%).
Unlimited paid time off. Our philosophy is that if you feel you need time off (for example, because of overwork, sickness, personal matters, etc.), we're not going to question that. We just ask that you don't abuse it and that you give us at least two weeks' notice if you plan to be away.

About Kadince

 Kadince (pronounced cadence) is a fully remote software company founded in 2013. In a nutshell, we build tools to help financial institutions track and manage the good they do in their communities.

 Kadince has been profitable for several years (we’re fans of making more than we spend). We’re bootstrapped, which means we don’t have investors. So our owners answer to no one. And they aren’t just giving us commands from their vacation homes waiting to cash their next check. They’re fellow team members and in the trenches with us.

 Why We’re Hiring

 After our team members, our customers are our most important focus. As our customer base grows, so does our team. We’re dedicated to giving each customer the best experience possible, which means having enough people to take care of all their needs. We’re growing quickly and so are the needs of our customers. That’s why we’re increasing the size of our development team.

 Who We Want to Hire

 To be a web developer at Kadince you should have 5+ years of experience. This experience has given you an understanding of basic database driven web applications and a proficient knowledge of the MVC pattern. You understand that software development is all about the end-user (again, we really care about our customers).

 You have a desire to continually learn and improve your development skills. We love giving team members opportunities to improve their skills, whether through online courses, workshops, or learning from others.

 You’re able to adapt quickly to new environments, are organized and focused, can look beyond current constraints (you know, forest through the trees), and can provide solutions to complex problems. Simply put, we need a problem solver, not a taskmaster.

 Our vision, mission, and core values should resonate with you. That’ll be crucial to your success and happiness if you join the Kadince team.

 Let’s Geek Out

 If you’re geeky like our dev team (hopefully you are), you probably want to know more about our tech-stack. Outside of our dev team, we’re not really sure what most of this means, but we sure hope you do.

 Technologies/Frameworks


 Ruby on Rails
GraphQL
Postgres
Redis
ReactJS
Rspec
Cypress



 DevOps


 Kubernetes
Helm
Docker
CircleCI



 Other Tools


 Jira
Rubymine
Sentry
Logrocket
Wooly Bugger



 Our Vision and Mission

 Our vision and mission aren’t something we hung on the office wall and forgot about. Seriously, we don’t have an office, let alone a wall to hang them on. But our vision, mission, and core values sit on the desks of each of our team members. And we discuss them regularly in our meetings. Your goals (KPIs) will be developed to ensure you’re working to help us achieve our vision and mission.

 Our vision and mission are what get us up each morning. They, in addition to our core values, help us make decisions.

 Vision - Setting the standard for operating a great software company.

 We’re big fans of author Jim Collins and his best-selling book, Good to Great (bonus points if you’ve read it). While there are lots of good software companies out there, we want to be one of the great ones.

 The first word of our vision is also significant. To go “high school English class” on you, the present participle “setting” illustrates that we’re not looking to set the standard and then be done, but that the standard is always moving and we’re always chasing it. We continually stop to recognize the awesome things we’ve done and then look for ways to do them even better.

 Mission - Building the best community involvement software for financial institutions™.

 As Jim Collins taught in his Hedgehog Concept (told you we think he’s great—pun intended), great companies need to determine what they can be the best at in the world and focus on that. There are so many things we could solve as a software company, but we’ve found what we think we can be the best in the world at and we stick to it every day.

 Our Core Values

 Our core values remind us who we are. They also guide us in the decisions we make. They’re listed in order of importance. If we have a question when making a decision about people, for example, we look to the core value above it to make our decision.




 Integrity - We’re honest with ourselves and others.


People - We understand that people are the foundation of Kadince and we act accordingly.


Care - We love what we do and do it consistently and intentionally to the best of our abilities.


Remarkability - We provide remarkable experiences to all who come into contact with Kadince.


Growth - We accept yesterday and improve today.




 What a Day in the Life of a Web Developer Looks Like

 Your day starts with a development team meeting where you go through announcements, sync up projects, and discuss any potential issues. After the meeting, you put your head down and work on your assigned tickets in Jira.

 You spend the first part of the day reviewing your notes and prioritizing tasks for the junior developers. You make sure that you and the other developers are working on the most important tasks first, but you’re free to choose which ones you work on.

 For lunch, you meet a friend at the cafe near his work. You haven’t seen your friend for a few months, so you talk about life and your careers. You can’t help but feel very lucky for the freedom you have to take a long lunch break and meet your friend, as he has to hurry back to the office and get working right at the hour.

 Back at home, you continue working on tickets in Jira. At one point a junior web developer calls you on Slack and asks how to fix an issue. You expertly show him the process and he thanks you for being so helpful.

 You notice that another developer has been really on top of it today, so you mention them in the company Slack channel and thank them for being so awesome. Many of your team members respond to your shoutout with party emojis and hearts.

 In the afternoon your team has a standup meeting where you discuss what projects you’re all working on and whether there’s anything anyone can do to help. Your leader points out one of the awesome projects you’re working on and thanks you for being so attentive to the users’ needs.

 After the standup you do some QA and manually test a couple of the changes your team made today. You write automated tests to ensure the functionality that was just worked on. You find one little bug, which you log and then fix easily.

 You finish up your day by taking a look at tomorrow’s schedule and planning accordingly.

 When and Where You’d Work and What You’d Work On

 Kadince is a principle-based company, which means we focus on principles, not policies. Since we’re a fully remote company, you’ll speak with Aaron Venezia, your leader, to determine when and where you’ll work. You’ll also work with your leader each week, month, quarter, and year to determine your goals (your KPIs or key performance indicators) and what you’ll work on.

 The principle is to work when and where you want as long as you meet or exceed your KPIs. This may mean planning your day around team meetings or working a longer day because you’ll be out of the office for the next week. Overall, your schedule needs to help you achieve our vision and mission and demonstrate our core values.

 At Kadince, work won’t tie you down to one location. You’ll be free to travel or relocate as you get the itch to try somewhere new. Want to spend a month abroad, working from a hotel and exploring the rest of the time? Go ahead. Just make sure you have a reliable high-speed internet connection (as if you would go anywhere without it anyway) and turn on the blurry filter during video calls so we don’t get jealous. We seriously get jealous. One of our teammates recently had zebras running around in the background of a video call during a team meeting. Come to find out he was working from the deck of his hotel at the Animal Kingdom in Disney World. Even though we were jealous, we thought it was pretty cool.

 Who You’d Be Working With

 We have over 30 team members (which makes us really happy since Kadince was started by two people in their basements). If hired, you’ll probably work with each team member in one way or another. Some of the people you’ll work with most frequently are:

 Aaron makes sure that Kadince software runs smoothly and that any problems are addressed quickly and efficiently. When it comes to software wizards, he’s the Dumbledore of web developers (but really, he wishes he was Voldemort). He’s been here since nearly the beginning of Kadince, so he’s seen it all. Aaron loves to go skiing and mountain biking, as well as play video games and pinball (can you beat him?). He’s very proud of the fact that he’s his tiny dog’s favorite person, and he has a strange passion for curly fries.

 Bernardo (better known around here as Beans) has been a web developer at Kadince since 2014. He’s originally from Chile, but has lived in Utah since he was 12. He loves to code, play video games, spend time with his wife, kids, and dogs. He also loves to learn new things. If he could do anything in the world he would go to space (although technically that’s not in this world, now is it?).

 Luis is a junior web developer and has worked for Kadince since 2019. He likes to hike, run, and be outdoors. Luis is fun and gets along with everyone, so feel free to joke around and have a good time. Just don’t play Rocket League with him. He WILL beat you. Actually, do play, lots of the other developers do. And if you’re lucky, he might share his grandma’s tamales with you.

 Benefits

 Since we’re a remote company, we don’t offer office snacks and ping pong tables. But if you’re a fan of “core benefits” that bring great rewards and peace of mind, you’ll like what we have to offer. Competitive pay, 401(k) matching, generous paid leave, insurance (medical, dental, vision, life, short-term disability), a flex spending account, and profit sharing. Yeah, it’s pretty great...

 And we love to spoil our team. We celebrate big events with you, like birthdays and work anniversaries, so you can expect some pretty fun gifts. We recently sent some high-quality lip balm to each team member so we could all play a prank on Scott, our Director of Product. We’re fun like that. And last year we gave every team member the final week of the year off (we like to spread holiday cheer).

 Every year, we go on a super fun retreat as a team. This isn’t your typical conference room and endless meetings shindig. We spend about 5 days getting to know each other and doing fun activities in a cool place. This year we’ll be at a resort in St. George, Utah (have you seen High School Musical 2?). Where will we go next?

 How to Apply

 Applicants who stand out are those who are interested in working for Kadince, not just applying for as many positions as possible or trying to keep unemployment benefits. We’ve seen it all. No kidding, we once had someone ask us in an interview what the name of our company is. Needless to say, we could tell that person wasn’t really passionate about joining our team.

 When applying to Kadince, please send us a PDF of your resume. The questions below are your opportunity to tell us why you would be a great fit for the position. Take advantage of this time. Seriously, sell yourself!

 Thank you for your interest in Kadince. We look forward to reviewing your application.

Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart
 See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)


 Execution Is Binary
 We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.
 We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.
 Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".


 Missionaries, Not Mercenaries
 We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.
 We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.
 We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.


 Inputs > Outcomes
 We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.
 We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.
 We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.
 We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.


 Honesty Over Harmony
 We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.
 We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.
 We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.
 We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.


 Invent & Iterate
 We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.
 We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.
 We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
 
Equal opportunity employer
 Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart
 See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)


 Execution Is Binary
 We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.
 We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.
 Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".


 Missionaries, Not Mercenaries
 We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.
 We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.
 We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.


 Inputs > Outcomes
 We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.
 We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.
 We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.
 We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.


 Honesty Over Harmony
 We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.
 We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.
 We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.
 We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.


 Invent & Iterate
 We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.
 We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.
 We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.
