28,Technical Content Developer (Platform Engineering) - Opportu...,VMware,"Remote in Austin, TX",NaN,2022-10-12,"
Technical Content Developer (Platform Engineering)

 As a Technical Content Developer for the Platform Engineering Team, you will create content to enable employees, partners and customers to successfully adopt cloud native solutions.

 Why You Will Enjoy this New Opportunity

 If you are an experienced Kubernetes Engineer who enjoys implementing customer solutions just as much as you do creating enablement material, the Technical Content Developer Position for Platform Engineering is the perfect opportunity for you. Together, we can bridge the gap between product documentation and field engineering implementation experiences, and ultimately share that knowledge with the world.

 In the role of a Technical Content Developer, you build content curriculum by working with Tanzu Labs Solution Architects (professional services), technical writers, and product managers to capture the knowledge required to successfully implement the Tanzu portfolio. You create, curate and distribute on-demand content through multiple online channels, including public websites, internal enablement platforms, learning management systems. You will also have the opportunity to present during webinars and conferences. You will also work closely with our target audience to get early feedback, and to develop feedback loops to help the team continually improve its material.

 You get to work across a diverse array of technologies. As a technical content developer, you might work on developing material about core Kubernetes topics for one month, then transition to work on material about secure software supply chains, or practices for deploying various styles of applications. This means you are constantly learning about new technologies and new customer needs.

 The content creators for Platform Services start new initiatives every 3 - 6 months. This gives the team opportunities to become immersed in new problems, and a wide array of potential solutions throughout the year.

 At Platform Services, our sweet spot is teaching clients how to be more effective at implementing Tanzu based platforms. As coaches and mentors, it's normal to be on a blended team of colleagues and clients who are eager to learn what we know.

 Solutions Architects at Tanzu Labs Platform Services are hungry to learn, and love sharing what they know. A diverse client base presents new problem spaces to Platform Services all the time.

 At Platform Services, we use the fundamentals of Agile, Lean, and User-Centered Design to guide us. Our teams are diverse because we’ve learned they are the most successful.

 If you want to work with a team of curious, brilliant, and kind technologists, come join us!
 The latest content accomplishments made by the Platform Services Content Development Team includes: 


Launching KubeAcademy from VMware, a collection of free content that focuses on upstream and open source Kubernetes learning for the Kubernetes community.
Creating Structured learning paths for KubeAcademy.
Developing CKAD exam practice material for KubeAcademy.Creating content for Securing Kubernetes on Tanzu Developer Center.
Creating content for the Building Kubernetes Runtime section of Tanzu Developer Center.

Linux, Windows and other operating systems found in the data center environment.
Cloud hyper-scaler technologies such as vSphere, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
Infrastructure and platform observability, networking, security, reliability engineering practices, and tools such as Prometheus \ Grafana, Wavefront, ingress/egress networking.
Automation technologies such as Github Actions, Gitlab Jobs, Jenkins, related continuous integration, automation and orchestration tools.
Languages, and frameworks such as GOlang, Java, and Spring.
Data tools such as Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, Rabbit, Kafka, Oracle.


 Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes you will work toward completing over the first 6-12 months?


1st Month: You’ve joined an existing team working to enhance or develop new content. You’ve learned our practices, and applied your engineering, curriculum development, and communications skills to develop content, and you’ve also contributed your knowledge to the team effort. You’ve created mechanisms to implement feedback loops with your target audience to help keep the material relevant for the jobs to be done by the learner. You have also made great strides in increasing your knowledge of the Tanzu product family, and the problems Tanzu solves for customers.



1st six months: You’ve made amazing improvements to your ability to deliver great content to your audience. You’ve rolled out several pieces of content to a progression of audiences, and your first content is live in one of our major channels, being used by platform engineers around the globe. Many people have told you how useful your material is at helping them adopt the new technology they rely on. Consumption of your material has caught fire, and is getting great reviews.



1st Year: You’ve created a deep portfolio of highly rated learning material on a variety of topics that is in high demand by cutting edge platform engineers around the globe. You’ve presented at major technology conferences. You have honed your techniques for digesting new technology and teaching it to others.

 Although your regular activities may be modified to suit your professional strengths, daily life at Tanzu Labs may include many, if not all of the following requirements:


Be a crucial member of a team dedicated to building great learning material that helps platform engineers learn new technology, new tools and new techniques to increase their effectiveness.

Publish articles and speak in venues outside of our core distribution channels to help reach a wider audience.
Learn new skills, and grow in your own career while contributing learnings back to others in our team so we can all grow and thrive together.


 Where is the role located?
 This role is remote and will not be assigned to a fixed office location. That means it could be done anywhere there is a strong internet connection, and limited distractions. VMware has a policy to empower employees to work wherever they feel the most productive, and healthy whether that be at home, a VMware office, or a coffee shop.

 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 We believe in collaborative, autonomous teams dedicated to achieving our customer’s goals. Our leadership strives to create a healthy environment for you to do your best work, and will empower you to work directly with your team to deliver great outcomes.

 We are big thinkers who generate a lot of ideas, treat each other with kindness, collaborate on initiatives that matter, and maintain a safe space for all. We support one another by whatever means necessary, and trust each other to get the job done right, in a way that accommodates a flexible schedule to balance work and life.

 Your manager will be an experienced Platform Engineer and courseware developer.. They will support your growth through training, mentorship, and stretch opportunities. You should expect regular, bi-weekly 1:1 meetings with your manager where they are focused on career planning and project support.

 We are passionate about new technology and teaching and building new ways for people to consume our material. We have a bias towards action and love to test ideas so we can learn and improve. We have learned that being empathetic, inclusive, and kind empowers people to achieve greatness. We look forward to welcoming team members, and work hard to make sure the onboarding process is smooth.

 Where is this role located?
 Like many companies, the COVID pandemic changed how we work. We are fortunate to be capable of running a strong business in a 100% remote working environment.

 However, we believe that the fastest way to build authentic relationships is in person. Our role as consultants requires us to work well with new teammates on many types of engagements. We navigate large customer organizations, facilitate team building and work towards shared goals. We’ve found that we can do this remotely when we have to, but it is faster when we are co-located. Kicking off customer engagements in-person also fosters happier and more productive remote days. Once the pandemic is behind us, we expect more in-person collaboration at one of our offices or at the customer's site (<20%)
